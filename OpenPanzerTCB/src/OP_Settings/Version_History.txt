0.92.12         11/25/2017 - Added event for cannon reload complete, used to play a notification sound when paired with the Open Panzer Sound Card.
0.92.11         08/17/2017 - Added track recoil functionality.
                           - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed.
                             It is advised to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing.                                                               
0.92.10         08/12/2017 - Add track overlay enable/disable functions (Open Panzer sound card only)
                           - Add transmission engage/disengage sounds (Open Panzer sound card only)
                           - Add individual volume adjustments for engine/effects/overlay (Open Panzer sound card only) 
                           - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed.
                             It is advised to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing.                                                               
0.92.09         08/11/2017 - Added "vehicle" speed to the sound class, in addition to "engine" speed which was already there. When used with the Open Panzer sound card, vehicle
                             speed will allow us to play track overlay sounds that vary with actual vehicle speed, on top of the engine sounds which are played relative to 
                             engine speed. 
                           - Fixed minor bug with the 2nd machine gun.
0.92.08         07/25/2017 - Added dedicated second machine gun functions. The effect could be created previously with the Aux output, but the dedicated functions simplify the
                             process and leave the Aux output free for other uses. If implemented, the second machine gun light should be connected to the L2 (Light 2) port.
                             The second machine gun has its own blink interval setting available in OP Config, independent of the primary machine gun blink interval. The
                             second machine gun will automaically trigger a sound effect if the sound card supports it. For the Benedini this will be whatever sound is placed 
                             in slot 11 of the 1st coder column in TBS Flash (otherwise called User Sound 3). For the Open Panzer Sound Card just add the sound files with the 
                             appropriate names to the micro SD card. 
                           - CRC checking has been added to the code that communicates with Pololu serial motor controllers. This prevents the Pololu from mistakenly reacting to
                             messages intended for other devices (for example the Open Panzer Sound Card). You must also enable CRC mode on your Pololu controller by using the
                             jumper as shown in the Pololu instructions. 
                           - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed.
                             It is advised to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing.                                 
0.92.07         07/18/2017 - Added ability to select Pan Servo for turret rotation. Most users will not want this but it can be useful for turret-less tanks (eg Jagdpanther) with a 
                             limited traverse barrel. 
                           - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed.
                             It is advised to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing.                                 
0.92.06         07/15/2017 - Added two ad-hoc triggers, "Cannon Hit" and "Vehicle Destroyed" that can be used to trigger any digital function. 
                           - Functionality for I/O Ports A&B has been expanded. When set to Output they now have the option to be "Default High" or "Default Low." Each 
                             also has a new function called "Pulse." If the Pulse function is triggered the external output pin A or B will briefly be held in the opposite 
                             direction of its default state. This can be used to emulate a button press to some external device. 
                           - New function "Inverse Flash" added for Aux Output. Works the same way as the regular Flash function except this one holds the output high (+5 volts)
                             normally, and during the flash brings the output momentarily to ground. Again, this can be used to emulate a button press for some external device. 
0.92.05         06/04/2017 - Added ability to trigger a brake sound automatically when vehicle brakes, presently only compatible with the Open Panzer Sound Card. The same effect
                             can be implemented with the Benedini TBS Mini, but you must load your brake sound as one of the user sounds, then trigger the user sound using the 
                             "Brakes Applied" trigger. 
0.92.04         04/17/2017 - Update firmware for compatibility with Benedini Flash v3.x. This increases the number of sounds available when using the TBS Mini among other improvements. 
0.92.03         03/10/2017 - Add a new option to enable a special feature of the Scout ESC that can "drag" the inner (slower) track during turns to assist in turning and steering for 
                             heavy models using free-wheeling gearboxes such as the Taigen V2 that tend to keep spinning rather than slowing down when power is reduced. The option can 
                             be enabled or disabled on the Driving tab of OP Config. If you don't have problems leave it disabled, but if you are using one of these free-wheeling gearboxes
                             and find it difficult to turn, give it a try and see if it helps. The option is only available on the Scout and only if the vehicle type is set to Tank or Halftrack 
                             in OP Config. The Scout must also be running the latest firmware (90.03 or later). 
                           - Condense functions for playing user sounds and squeaks. Add additional user sound functions for a total of 6 available on some cards. For now we are still 
                             posting code for Benedini Flash v1 but it too will permit up to 6 user sounds when v3 is released.
                           - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed.
                             It is advised to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing.                           
0.92.02         03/03/2017 - Added additional trigger sources - speed-based (vehicle goes above or falls below some user defined speed percentage) and ad-hoc triggers 
                             (presently the only one is "brakes applied" but we can add up to 16 in the future). These triggers departs from the traditional "input" and represent 
                             instead "events" from which the user may want other events to be triggered. 
0.92.01         02/26/2017 - Fixed bug caused by enabling Timer 1 Output Compare C interrupt but not having an ISR defined. These interrupts were enabled in both OP_SBusDecode.cpp
                             and OP_iBusDecode.cpp, but in fact neither were needed. 
                           - Moved all libraries to src subfolder of sketch folder. This will make it much more easier for developers to fork the project. 
                           - Reverted to the original TBS functionality compatible with TBS Flash v1 since Benedini has yet to officially release v3.x and we are getting nervous. 
                           - Added two special functions for manual on/off control of the smoker output, can be used as a high-current switch of battery voltage (manual analog control
                             function was already present). 
0.91.02         02/12/2017 - Updated TBS library for compatibility with the new version of Benedini's TBS Flash (probably v3.x). This adds 4 more sounds, we use one for barrel elevation, 
                             one for a user sound (for a total of 3), and two as dedicated volume increase/decrease functions. 
0.91.01         02/07/2017 - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed.
                             It is advised to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing.                           
                           - Added ability to automatically flash the Aux Light output when cannon is fired. Flash will last for user specified time and will be triggered
                             at the correct location in the cannon fire sequence, accounting for any delays the user may have specified under the mechanical recoil option.
                             This option will hopefully be useful for people using an ordinary LED for muzzle flash instead of the high-intensity flash units. The Aux Light
                             could already be flashed with cannon before but it required the user to assign their cannon trigger to the Aux Flash function, not a big deal 
                             but this eliminates that step. 
0.91.00         02/04/2017 - Added new drive type specifically for cluch-style gearboxes such as the DKLM RC PDSGB.
                           - Added functionality for OP Config to check what minimum version of OP Config the TCB expects, and what minimum version of TCB firmware OP Config expects. 
                             If either the TCB or OP Config is found to be older than the other is expecting, we will warn the user on TCB connection and remind them to update
                             as appropriate. 
00.90.24        01/30/2017 - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed. 
                             It is advised to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing.- Corrected a bug introduced with 90.23. ResetBattle() is passed as a void function pointer in the SimpleTimer class, but adding a parameter to the 
                             function causes erratic behavior. This was difficult to troubleshoot because newer versions of the Arduino IDE failed to throw an error, however 1.6.8
                             did. We still removed the invulnerability period on first boot but we have corrected the error by simply using a second function instead of adding a parameter
                             to the original.
                           - Support for Taigen sound cards has been added. A new class OP_TaigenSound was created. Some adjustments were made to GetThrottleSpeed() in OP_Driver as well
                             to help smooth out the sound. 
                           - A bug was found in GetThrottleSpeed() in OP_Driver that was corrected. It only came into play if acceleration ramping was used, which up to today it never had been. 
                           - Support for a future Open Panzer sound card has been added. A new class OP_SoundCard was created. This library is a work in progress that won't be fully completed
                             until developmenton the actual sound card is farther along, but basic features are operable. 
00.90.23        01/19/2017 - IMPORTANT NOTE: This release was found to be flawed. Firmware version 00.90.23 should not be used. 
                           - Removed the invulnerability period when TCB first boots. This causes endless confusion when you attempt to test IR reception and for the first 
                             10-15 seconds after applying power (depending on weight class) the tank is invulnerable. Invulnerability is really intended to apply only after 
                             the tank has been destroyed and is in the process of regenerating; we don't need it at boot. 
00.90.22        01/11/2017 - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed. It is advised 
                             to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing. 
                           - Fixed bug with radio detect routine when being run from within OP_PCComm (sketches timer was not being updated)
                           - Adjusted timing of radio detection to make it feasible to test for all three protocols within the 1 second alloted by OP Config
                           - Adjusted number of frames thrown out for iBus when streaming data to the PC in order not to overload OP Config, iBus is an even 
                             worse case than SBus due to the slightly higher baud rate. Now we keep only 1 out of every 3 frames when streaming to OP Config, but
                             in normal operation we keep every other, same as SBus. Also made it easy to adjust these parameters for both SBus and iBus, there is
                             a distinct setting now for the number of frames discarded during normal operation and the number discarded during streaming to the PC, 
                             see the .h files for both classes. PPM doesn't need this functionality. 
                           - When being asked by OP Config to save the value to some variable which the TCB does not recognize, the TCB used to respond with a
                             repeat command. Changed this to a response for next sentence (same as it would if it did recognize the variable), althought it does
                             set a flag in the response so OP Config will know. The most common cause for this issue to occur, as I discovered, is running a 
                             version of OP Config more recent than the firmware version on the TCB. In that case the user should re-flash but it's also probably
                             fine to just skip the unknown variable. 
                           - A good deal of changes to the sound class. OP_TBS is now a sub-class of OP_Sound, as is the new OP_SoundCard subclass which will
                             be used to communicate with a future Open Panzer sound card. Various other additional variables were created for the additional 
                             sounds that will be possible with the OP card, as well as new functions such as setting the volume with an analog trigger. 
00.90.21        01/03/2017 - Fixed a small bug with the smoker that only presented itself when manually enabled/disabled using a function trigger.
00.90.20        12/15/2016 - Add a Null_Motor drive type, which can be used when the user chooses to detach the turret stick controls 
                             from actually controlling the turret. 
00.90.19        12/05/2016 - A million things I didn't bother recording during development.
00.90.16        04/12/2016 - Fixed debug LED behavior on braking. PCComm class can now try to initialize the radio after communication with 
                             PC has started, in the event the user forgets to turn their radio on until after, or communcation begins before
                             the sketch has a chance to set it up. Fixed machine gun LED pin number, was incorrect for current board. 
00.90.15        4/02/2016  - Added FlySky iBus support, up to 14 channels. Required board change to Rev 0.19. 
                             Tested with FlySky i10 transmitter and FS-iA10 and FS-iA6B receivers.
00.90.14        3/25/2016  - Local dev copy
00.90.13        3/25/2016  - Added printed function names in Debug dump
                           - RC Output pass-throughs can now be of type regular or Pan Servo
00.90.12        3/13/2016  - Posted to GitHub
